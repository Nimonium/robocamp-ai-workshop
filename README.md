# 🤖 AI & Robotics Summer Workshop

A full-stack registration landing page for a kids' AI & Robotics summer camp — built with React, Tailwind CSS, Express, and MongoDB.

🔗 **Live Demo:** [robocamp-ai-workshop.vercel.app](https://robocamp-ai-workshop.vercel.app)
📦 **Backend API:** [robocamp-api-2pty.onrender.com](https://robocamp-api-2pty.onrender.com)

## ✨ Features

- 🎨 Pixel-faithful recreation of a Kidrove-style illustrated design system
- 📱 Fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop
- 🧩 Strongly typed React components with content cleanly separated from markup
- ✅ Real-time client-side form validation (name, email, phone)
- 🔐 Server-side validation with Zod — never trusts the client alone
- 🗄️ Optional MongoDB persistence with a graceful "mock mode" fallback
- 🚀 Deployed and live on Vercel (frontend) + Render (backend)

## 🛠 Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| **Frontend** | React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS |
| **Backend** | Node.js, Express, TypeScript, Zod |
| **Database** | MongoDB via Mongoose (optional) |
| **Deployment** | Vercel (client) · Render (server) |

```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18 or newer
- npm or yarn

### 1. Backend Setup (`/server`)

```bash
cd server
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # then fill in your values
npm run dev
```

**Environment variables (`server/.env`):**

| Variable | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT` | Port the server runs on (default 5000) | No |
| `MONGODB_URI` | MongoDB connection string | No — runs in mock mode if omitted |
| `CLIENT_URL` | Frontend origin, for CORS (e.g. `http://localhost:5173`) | Yes |

### 2. Frontend Setup (`/client`)

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

**Create `client/.env`:**

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` 🎉

## 📡 API Documentation

### `GET /api/health`

Health check endpoint.

**Response:**

```json
{ "status": "ok" }
```

### `POST /api/enquiry`

Submits a new workshop registration enquiry.

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "phone": "+919876543210"
}
```

**Success Response — 200 OK:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Enquiry submitted successfully",
  "data": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "phone": "+919876543210",
    "_id": "64d...",
    "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

**Error Response — 400 Bad Request:**

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "errors": {
    "email": "Valid email is required"
  }
}
```

> 💡 **If `MONGODB_URI` isn't set**, the API still returns a valid success response — it just skips persistence and logs a warning, so the app never breaks in a database-less environment.

## ☁️ Deployment

### Frontend → Vercel

1. Import this repo into Vercel
2. Set Root Directory to `client`
3. Add environment variable `VITE_API_URL` pointing to your live backend URL
4. Deploy

*The included `client/vercel.json` handles SPA routing rewrites automatically.*

### Backend → Render

1. Connect this repo to Render via Blueprint (auto-detects `render.yaml` at the root)
2. Set `CLIENT_URL` to your live Vercel URL (required for CORS)
3. Optionally set `MONGODB_URI` for real persistence
4. Deploy

> ⚠️ Render's free tier spins down after inactivity — the first request after idling may take 30–60 seconds to respond while the instance wakes up.

## 🧪 Local Testing Checklist

- [x] Submitting the form with empty/invalid fields shows inline validation errors
- [x] Submitting valid data shows a success message
- [x] Server console logs the incoming request payload
- [x] App runs correctly with and without `MONGODB_URI` set
- [x] Layout holds up at mobile, tablet, and desktop widths

## 📝 My Approach & Improvements

My approach combined AI-assisted tooling with hands-on debugging rather than treating it as a one-shot generation. I started by designing the UI in Stitch, modeled closely on Kidrove's playful, illustrated visual language, then handed that design over to Gemini 3.1 Pro (via Antigravity) to scaffold a typed, production-shaped monorepo: a React + TypeScript + Tailwind client and an Express + TypeScript + Zod server with optional MongoDB persistence. From there, my role shifted to integration and QA — I ran the app locally, deliberately tested edge cases, and traced down real issues as they surfaced: a Tailwind v4/v3 config mismatch breaking the PostCSS pipeline, a broken email/phone validation regex rejecting valid input, and a Zod version mismatch (.errors vs .issues) that failed the production TypeScript build on Render. Each was diagnosed from actual error logs and fixed with a verified, tested commit rather than guesswork. I deployed the client to Vercel and the server to Render, then closed the loop on CORS configuration and confirmed the full registration flow worked end-to-end in production, not just locally.

With more time, I'd add automated tests (Jest + React Testing Library on the frontend, Supertest on the API) so regressions like the ones I hit manually would be caught automatically. I'd also add rate-limiting and basic spam protection on `/api/enquiry`, an email confirmation step on successful registration, a lightweight admin view to browse submitted enquiries, and a proper CI pipeline to run lint/build/test checks on every push before deployment.
